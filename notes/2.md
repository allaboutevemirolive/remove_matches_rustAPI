What is the problem with the current remove_matches API below

```rust
pub fn remove_matches<'a, P>(&'a mut self, pat: P)
where
    P: for<'x> Pattern<'x>,
{
    use core::str::pattern::Searcher;

    let rejections = {
        let mut searcher = pat.into_searcher(self);

        let mut front = 0;
        let rejections: Vec<_> = from_fn(|| {
            let (start, end) = searcher.next_match()?;
            let prev_front = front;
            front = end;
            Some((prev_front, start))
        })
        .collect();
        rejections
            .into_iter()
            .chain(core::iter::once((front, self.len())))
    };

    let mut len = 0;
    let ptr = self.vec.as_mut_ptr();

    for (start, end) in rejections {
        let count = end - start;
        if start != len {
                
            unsafe {
                ptr::copy(ptr.add(start), ptr.add(len), count);
            }
        }
        len += count;
    }

    unsafe {
        self.vec.set_len(len);
    }
}
```


The current `remove_matches` API has a few potential issues that might make it less desirable in certain scenarios:

1. **In-place Modification with Allocation**: The API modifies the original string in-place by copying the non-matching parts of the string to a new memory location. This operation involves allocating a new buffer of the appropriate size and copying the data into it. This means that the function performs additional memory allocation, which could impact performance, especially when working with large strings.

2. **Complexity and Safety Concerns**: The implementation relies heavily on unsafe code. The use of unsafe pointers and direct memory manipulation introduces complexity and increases the risk of bugs related to pointer arithmetic, buffer overflows, and undefined behavior. Unsafe code should be used sparingly and only when necessary for performance reasons, with great care taken to ensure safety.

3. **Inefficient for Overlapping Matches**: The current implementation uses a linear search approach to find matches, which may not be efficient when dealing with overlapping matches. Overlapping matches may result in redundant copy operations, leading to suboptimal performance.

4. **Potential for Runtime Panics**: The function assumes that the `P` pattern implements the `Pattern` trait correctly and may panic at runtime if the trait requirements are not met. This can make the function less robust and harder to reason about in certain situations.

5. **Lack of Error Handling**: The function does not provide a mechanism for handling or reporting errors. If the input pattern is invalid or if an internal error occurs during the matching process, the function may not handle such cases gracefully.

6. **Restricted to Mutable Strings**: The API is specifically designed for `&mut String` objects, which means it cannot be used with other types or immutable strings. This restriction might limit its flexibility in some scenarios.

Given these potential issues, it's essential to carefully consider the trade-offs and the specific use case when deciding whether to use the current `remove_matches` API or consider alternative approaches that might be more suitable for the task at hand.
