In Rust, how to convert from String to &str and vice versa
```


In Rust, you can convert between `String` and `&str` using the following methods:

1. Convert from `String` to `&str`:
   You can convert a `String` to a `&str` by taking a reference to the `String`. This operation is called "borrowing" and allows you to work with the `String`'s data without taking ownership or copying the contents.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
    let my_str: &str = &my_string;

    // Now you can work with my_str as a borrowed reference to the original my_string.
    println!("{}", my_str);
}
```

2. Convert from `&str` to `String`:
   To convert a `&str` to a `String`, you can use the `to_string()` method of the `str` slice. This will create a new `String` instance that owns a copy of the data.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_str = "Hello, Rust!";
    let my_string: String = my_str.to_string();

    // Now you can work with my_string as an owned String.
    println!("{}", my_string);
}
```

Additionally, there is another method to convert from `&str` to `String` using the `String::from()` function:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_str = "Hello, Rust!";
    let my_string: String = String::from(my_str);

    // Now you can work with my_string as an owned String.
    println!("{}", my_string);
}
```

Remember that converting from `String` to `&str` is borrowing, and the `&str` slice will only be valid as long as the original `String` is in scope and not modified. Converting from `&str` to `String` is an allocation, and it creates a new `String` instance that owns a copy of the data.
